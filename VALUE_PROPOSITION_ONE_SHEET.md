# Unified Presentation Framework - One Sheet

---

## Value Proposition

**Stop rebuilding presentations from scratch. Start composing from modules.**

The Unified Presentation Framework is a modular system for creating professional presentations, product pages, and marketing decks with natural language editing. Build once, update surgically—change a single stat, swap a theme, reorder slides—without regenerating the entire deck.

Your existing visualization skills (cinematic-scroll-deck, emotional-viz, d3, COD HUD) become composable modules. CIQ brand standards become a pluggable package you load when needed, not a core dependency. Extract themes from any website or design mockup, then apply them instantly.

**The result:** Create presentations 10x faster with consistent quality. Update a pricing slide in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes. Switch from CIQ branding to client branding with one command. Generate training decks, sales presentations, and executive briefings from the same modular codebase.

Your personal IP. Your visual library. Infinite compositions.
